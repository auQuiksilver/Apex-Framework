Zeus Key Bindings

There are a number of scripts available to Zeus to aid in rapid mission creation.

The key bindings are listed ingame, on the map diary tabs under "Key Bindings", when logged in as Zeus.

Here is a small explanation of how to use them:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Sync Editable Objects - [Shift]+[F3]

	- Add all AI to Zeus

2. (Selected Group) Garrison in Buildings - [Numpad 1]

	- Select a group of AI and press the key, they will garrison in nearby buildings.

3. (Selected Group) Patrol Area - [Numpad 2]

	- Select a group and press the key, the group will get nearby patrol waypoints. You can then click and drag these waypoints to more logical patrol locations.

4. (Selected Group) Search Building - [Numpad 3]

	-  Select a group, and press the key. The group will attempt to clear the nearest building.
	- Alternatively, select a group and give it a MOVE waypoint, and press the key. The group will attempt to clear the nearest building to its move waypoint.

5. (Selected Group) Stalk Target - [Numpad 4]

	- Select a group, and give it a MOVE waypoint nearby an enemy (player). The waypoint will disappear, and the group will chase the enemy that was nearest to the waypoint.

6. (Selected Group) Suppressive Fire - [Numpad 6]

	- Note, only works when group is already in combat.
	- Select a group, and press the key. The group will perform suppressive fire on existing targets.

7. (Selected Unit) Revive Player - [Numpad 7]

	- Select a player, and press the key. If the player was incapacitated, they should be revived.

8. (All Players) View Directions - [Numpad 8]

	- Press the key. You will see where all players are looking. This can help with placement of enemies during battle, so the players dont see you spawn things in.

9. (Selected Unit) Set unit Unconscious - [Numpad 9]

	- Does not work on players.
	- Select an AI unit, and press the key. The unit will go unconscious. They can then be carried/dragged/revived.

10. (Selected Group) Offload AI to Server (Network ownership) - [Shift] + [F4]

	- For network performance reasons, its often better for AI to be controlled by server. There can be some performance degradation if Zeus has network ownership of too many AI.
	- When making large Zeus missions (where performance will be impacted), this allows Zeus to easily give network ownership of AI to server.

11. (Selected Objects) Turn lights & headlights on/off - [L]

	- Select a light or vehicle, and press your "Headlights" key binding. [L] by default. 

12. (Selected building) Raise/Lower structure - [-][=]

	- Use your "Time acceleration (accTime)" key bindings to raise/lower selected buildings.
	- Only works on buildings & fortifications.
